# Summary

1. The Future is broke, donâ€™t go there.
2. Manage stack safety with a Trampoline.

3. The Monad Transformer Library (MTL) abstracts over common effects with typeclasses.

4. Monad Transformers provide default implementations of the MTL.

5. Free data structures let us analyse, optimise and easily test our programs.

6. IO gives us the ability to implement algebras as effects on the world.

7. IO can perform effects in parallel and is a high performance backbone for any application.

8. Prefer Effect, Parallel, and related typeclasses, to using IO directly.
